# Current Tasks

- Swim cap/ headset 3d print
- figure out noise cancelling algo/ method
- 10/20 spacing and validation of data with literature values
- Figure out pyserial
  - how does it output values
  - whats the most efficient way to handle output to file
  - can we somehow output different electrodes seperately
- Figure out what other circuit elements required
  - how would having multiple outputs change circuit
  - how do we add a button or something for only having data events and not trash
- Figure out data pipeline
  -
- Figure out everyones roles
  - Ryan
    - brain science stuff ?
  - Max
    - Circuit design / hardware ?
  - Nick
